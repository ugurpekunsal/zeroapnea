        <h2 class="section__description">What is sleep apnea?</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep apnea is a serious sleep disorder. People who have sleep apnea
          stop breathing for 10 seconds to 30 seconds at a time while they are
          sleeping. These short stops in breathing can happen up to 400 times
          every night. If you have sleep apnea, periods of not breathing can
          disturb your sleep (even if they don’t fully wake you up).
        </p>
        <h2 class="section__description">Is sleep apnea common?</h2>
        <p>
          An estimated 5.4 million Canadian adults have been diagnosed with
          sleep apnea or are at high risk of experiencing obstructive sleep
          apnea. Men, people who are overweight, and people who are older than
          40 years of age are more likely to have sleep apnea. However, it can
          affect anyone at any age.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section__description">Will this problem change my life?</h2>
        <p>
          Actually, sleep apnea may already have affected you more than you
          know. Chances are things will improve for you once the diagnosis is
          made and you start treatment. Whatever your treatment, remember that
          you are not alone and help is available.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section__description">
          How do I know if I have sleep apnea?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Because some of the symptoms of sleep apnea occur while you’re
          sleeping, your bed partner may notice it first. You, or that person,
          may notice heavy snoring or long pauses in your breathing during
          sleep. Even if you don’t remember waking up during the night, you may
          notice daytime sleepiness (such as falling asleep at work, while
          driving or when talking), irritability or fatigue. You may also
          experience morning headaches, forgetfulness, mood changes and a
          decreased interest in sex.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section__header">Causes &amp; Risk Factors.</h3>
        <h2 class="section__description">What causes sleep apnea?</h2>
        <p>
          There are 2 kinds of sleep apnea: obstructive apnea and central apnea.
          Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common type. Nine out of 10 people
          who have sleep apnea have this type of apnea. If you have obstructive
          apnea, something is blocking the airway that brings air into your body
          (also called the trachea). When you try to breathe, you can’t get
          enough air because of the blockage. Your airway might be blocked by
          your tongue, tonsils or uvula (the little piece of flesh that hangs
          down in the back of your throat). It might also be blocked by a large
          amount of fatty tissue in the throat or by relaxed throat muscles.
          Central sleep apnea is less common. This type of sleep apnea is
          related to the function of the central nervous system. If you have
          this type of apnea, the muscles you use to breathe don’t get the
          “go-ahead” signal from your brain. Either the brain doesn’t send the
          signal, or the signal gets interrupted.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section__header">Diagnosis &amp; Tests.</h3>
        <h2 class="section__description">How is sleep apnea diagnosed?</h2>
        <p>
          Your healthcare provider can diagnose sleep apnea. They may ask you if
          you feel tired or sleepy during the day. Your healthcare provider may
          also want to know about your bedtime habits and how well you sleep.
          Your healthcare provider may ask you to go to a sleep disorder center
          for a sleep study. Tests done at the sleep disorder center may reveal
          which kind of sleep apnea you have. You may also need to take some
          equipment home with you to do a sleep study there.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section__description">
          Is there anything I can do to help my sleep apnea?
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <p>Yes. The following steps help many people who have sleep apnea:</p>
          <li>
            <p>
              Stop all use of alcohol or sleep medicines. These relax the
              muscles in the back of your throat, making it harder for you to
              breathe.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If you smoke, quit smoking.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>If you are overweight, lose weight.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Sleep on your side instead of on your back.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          We will make the trip to pick-up your CPAP or BiPAP machine and
          provide you with a disclaimer and limitation of liability clause as
          part of your donation.
        </p>
        <h2 class="section__description">How is sleep apnea treated?</h2>
        <p>
          Certain dental devices can be used to treat mild cases of obstructive
          sleep apnea. These devices move your jaw forward to make breathing
          easier. A common treatment for sleep apnea is called “continuous
          positive airway pressure,” or CPAP. In this treatment, you wear a
          special mask over your nose and mouth while you are sleeping. The mask
          will keep your airway open by adding pressure to the air you breathe.
          It helps most people who have sleep apnea. In very few cases, surgery
          is necessary to remove tonsils or extra tissue from the throat.
        </p>
        <h3 class="section__header">Complications.</h3>
        <h2 class="section__description">Is sleep apnea dangerous?</h2>
        <p>
          Sleep apnea can cause serious problems if it isn’t treated. Your risk
          of high blood pressure, heart failure and stroke is higher if you have
          serious sleep apnea that goes untreated. You are also more likely to
          have traffic accidents if you drive while you’re sleepy. If you have
          sleep apnea, it is very important to get treatment.
