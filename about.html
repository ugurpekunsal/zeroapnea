        <p>
          Zero Apnea.org© Association provides help for diagnosed sleep apnea
          patients who have no insurance, high insurance deductibles, or through
          financial hardship cannot afford this critical and life-saving medical
          equipment. Many Ontarians with sleep apnea want to help others with
          the same condition by donating their CPAP machine when they get a new
          one or simply when they no longer need it. These people do not know
          who to contact or which organization to donate to. We are a group of
          volunteers who have established <b>Zero Apnea.org©</b> platform to
          collect donations of CPAP machines and distribute them to needy
          patients who cannot afford this therapy. Whether you are newly
          diagnosed with sleep apnea or an active CPAP user, this website will
          help you make the most of your therapy!
        </p>
        <h2 class="section__description">Some facts first:</h2>
        <p>
          Ontario&#39;s population reached <b>14,745,040</b> on April 1, 2020,
          with an increase of <b>33,213 people</b> during the first quarter of
          2020.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              An estimated <b>442,351 (3%) Ontarian adults</b> 18 years and
              older reported being told by a health professional that they
              have <b>sleep apnea.</b>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              In addition to those who reported being diagnosed with sleep
              apnea, <b>over 1 in 4 (26%) adults</b> reported symptoms and risk
              factors that are associated with a <b
                >high risk of having or developing obstructive sleep apnea.</b
              >
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Sleep apnea is a condition that causes you to stop breathing while you
          sleep. This condition can cause other major health issues like heart
          arrythmia, stroke, diabetes, depression and more.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unfortunately, with 11% of Ontarians living in poverty, not everyone
          can afford therapy for this condition, which can range from $1500 -
          $6000.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because of this, the ZeroApnea.org of Ontario started the Sleep Apnea
          Refurbishment Program. We collect gently-used, newer models of CPAP
          and BiPAP machines. Students from Algonquin College’s School of Health
          and Community Studies work to refurbish the machines for distribution
          to patients who could otherwise not afford therapy.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have a CPAP machine that you no longer use or need, you may be
          looking for the best way to get rid of it. Should you donate a CPAP
          machine, sell it, or simply throw it out? Throwing it out is not a
          great option since this is a costly machine that could help someone
          else, but what are your options? Here is a closer look at what you can
          do with a used CPAP machine to keep it out of the dumpster and
          potentially do some good for someone else.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is not legal to sell a CPAP machine to someone who does not have a
          valid prescription for it, because these are medical devices. While
          you may be able to find people selling on Craigslist, facebook or
          Kijiji for instance, this is not the best route because it’s
          technically illegal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though people who cannot afford their device but need a CPAP machine
          will look on Craigslist, facebook or Kijiji, the machines sold there
          may or may not work properly, the seller may not post accurate listing
          information, and the machine may not be set to the correct mode or
          pressure.
        </p>
        <p>
          On Ebay, you can only sell CPAP devices if you have permission from
          the appropriate regulatory authorities to do so, which would not apply
          to most people selling a used device. If you are looking to sell a
          used CPAP, you will need to go through an authorized reseller who will
          sell to individuals with prescriptions, rather than trying to sell on
          the open marketplace.
        </p>
        <p>
          The option that we offer you, and potentially best, option is to
          donate the device. Donating your CPAP machine will get it out of your
          home, give you a tax benefit, and allow you to help someone who needs
          sleep apnea treatment but may not be able to afford it. Here&#39;s how
          and why you may wish to donate your used CPAP machine.
